# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in Hopscotch.

## How to propose changes
1. Open an issue describing the change (problem statement + proposed solution).
2. Submit a pull request referencing the issue.
3. Include updates to:
   - `SPEC.md` (normative language with MUST/SHOULD/MAY)
   - `CHANGELOG.md`
   - `schemas/` (if applicable)
   - `examples/` (if the change affects modeling patterns)

## Normative language
The spec uses RFC-style requirement keywords (MUST, SHOULD, MAY). Contributions should preserve the distinction between normative requirements and non-normative guidance.

## Compatibility
Until v1.0.0, breaking changes may be accepted if they materially improve implementability and are justified by a concrete use case.
